This benchmarking framework ported cross multiple languages to obtain comparible performance metrics across different implementations.
In addition to performance benchmarking, it helps in other types of non-functional testing like load, reliability or concurrency.

* Measures performance in **transactions per second** or **TPS** 
* Supports **active** (by calling Execute method) or **passive** (by reporting via Context) measurement methods
* Supports **configuration parameters** to set connection strings or other settings for benchmarks
* Runs benchmarks **sequentially** or in **parallel** by allocating % of calls proportional to benchmark frequency
* Measures **peak** or **nominal** performance at specified transaction rate
* Measures **system utilization** (RAM and CPU) during benchmarking process
* Measures overall **environment** performance (CPU, Video, Disk) for objective interpretation of results
* Capture and **errors** or **validation** results
* **Console** and **GUI runners** to execute benchmarks
